# ECCS Platform: Daily Log

A plain record of what was done each working day, newest day first. One entry per day, written at the end of the day.

How this differs from the other docs:

- `STATUS.md` says where the project stands **now** (what is built, decided, open). It is updated as work happens.
- `PROPOSAL.md` says **what** we are building and why.
- This file says **what happened when**. Entries are not rewritten later; a correction goes in the day it was found.

Each entry has the same parts: what was built, what the founder decided, what was tested and how, problems found, and what was left open.

## Tuesday 6 October 2026

*In progress. To be written up at the end of the day.*

**So far today**

- Started this daily log and wrote up 5 October.
- The founder retested photo upload on the Android phone: it works.
- Founder decision: problems noted on a checklist stay inside the restaurant and are never sent to ECCS. ECCS support is a separate channel; Head Chefs can raise issues there too.
- Built ECCS support. In the app: raise an issue (category, description, optional photos), see its status, exchange messages with ECCS, call or WhatsApp ECCS; the Owner or Manager can close or reopen an issue. In the console: an Issues page across all clients where ECCS replies and marks issues in progress or resolved.
- Tested with 8 new end-to-end tests (69 in total) and by clicking through the whole loop in Chrome: raised an issue in the app, replied and changed status in the console, saw the reply in the app. Not yet tried on the phone.
- Pushed the whole repository to GitHub at the founder's request: https://github.com/abdmath-eso/eccs.
- Founder feedback: the app's "Raise an issue with ECCS" and "ECCS support" pages were redundant. Merged them into one page named "Raise an issue" with the form, the call and WhatsApp buttons and recent issues, opened from a single home tile. On further feedback the form was tucked behind a "Raise an issue" button so the page opens showing only the button, the contact buttons and recent issues.
- Founder rule: commit locally through the day and push to GitHub once at end of day, when the founder says so.

**Carried over from yesterday**

- ~~The phone photo-upload fix needs the founder's retest.~~ Done, works.
- The founder has not yet chosen the next feature. Recommended: issues and ECCS support.

## Monday 5 October 2026

The first day. Started from an empty Windows machine and ended with a working login, an ECCS web console and a complete daily checklist feature running on the founder's Android phone. 18 commits.

### Planning and setup

- Wrote the proposal: tech stack, roles and permissions, data model, pilot scope, roadmap and folder structure (`docs/PROPOSAL.md`).
- Read the founder's whiteboard photo (`image.png`), which listed twelve restaurant-app features, and folded all twelve into the pilot scope. The estimate moved from about 10 weeks to about 16 to 18.
- Created the status tracker (`docs/STATUS.md`) and the instructions file new Claude sessions read first (`CLAUDE.md`).
- Installed Git, Node 24, pnpm and the VS Code extensions. The founder enabled virtualisation and installed WSL2 and Docker Desktop.
- Scaffolded the project: a web app (Next.js), an API (NestJS) and a mobile app (Expo) in one repository.
- Started the local database, Redis and photo storage in Docker, and created the full database schema (about 48 tables) with sample restaurants, users and data.

### Login and roles

- Built the six roles (Super Admin, Operations Manager, Supervisor on the ECCS side; Owner, Manager, Head Chef on the restaurant side) with one shared definition of who may do what.
- First version of login used a phone number and one-time code for everyone. The founder then specified a different design, which replaced it the same day:
  - The Owner is onboarded once with a mobile number and one-time code, and is given a 4-digit PIN.
  - After that nobody at the restaurant uses one-time codes. Everyone logs in with a PIN, and whose PIN it is decides what they see.
  - A new phone is linked once by typing the outlet's restaurant code.
  - The Owner or Manager adds staff and is shown each person's generated PIN once.
  - No biometrics on the restaurant side. ECCS staff keep using a mobile number and one-time code.
- Built the mobile screens: welcome, restaurant code, PIN pad, phone number, one-time code, a home screen that differs by role, and a staff logins screen. English, Telugu and Hindi.

### ECCS web console

- Login for ECCS staff, a clients page listing every restaurant with its owner, outlets and restaurant codes, and "Onboard a restaurant", which creates the brand, its first outlet, a restaurant code and the owner's login in one step.
- Restaurant codes are also shown to the Owner and Manager in the app so they can hand them to staff.

### Daily checklists

Built in stages through the afternoon as the founder gave feedback.

- Read the founder's `FSSAI 2026 KITCHEN SAFETY CHECKLIST.docx`. Its daily opening and closing checks became two short basic checklists of five items each. Its 92 detailed inspection checks were set aside for the ECCS inspection feature.
- Filling in a checklist: a photo per item, OK or Problem, submit. Photos are stored privately and shown through links that expire.
- After the founder uploaded a first photo and asked how it looked: added a done or problem mark, a stamp on each photo with the date, time and name of whoever took it, and a full-size view.
- One checklist per outlet per day, shared by all head chefs. Once anyone submits it, nobody else can change it.
- The Owner or Manager can create extra checklists (for example a mid-day one), set due times, and add or remove their own items.
- A red clock on a checklist past its due time, and a red exclamation mark on one where a problem was reported. A problem must come with a reason.
- Loaded the founder's `Restaurant_Master_Checklist_Library.xlsx` (588 checks in 65 checklists) plus 52 checks Claude wrote for Indian kitchens. The add-item box now searches this library as the person types; they tap a match to add it or add their own text.
- Items can be "photo needed" (the default) or "tick only" for checks where a photo is not possible. Tick-only items are ticked with one tap.
- The founder called the checklist feature done for now.

### Decisions the founder made

- Approved the tech stack.
- Company-side roles are Super Admin, Operations Manager and Supervisor only. Technicians do not get the app.
- Android and iOS, on staff's own phones. All three languages.
- Use sample data for company details, prices, SOPs and certificates for now.
- All twelve whiteboard items are in the pilot. Attendance and salary are for the restaurant's own staff. The customer QR is a public page with the score, service times and photos. Food labels are printed.
- The login design described above, with restaurant codes and 4-digit PINs.
- Everything on the restaurant side must work in the mobile app.
- The checklist rules described above.
- Benched: adding a whole library checklist ("pack") in one tap.

### How it was tested

- 61 automated end-to-end tests on the API, covering login, roles, onboarding, checklists, photo upload and the library search.
- Claude clicked through the main screens in Chrome using the browser preview of the mobile app.
- In the evening the founder ran the app on an Android phone through Expo Go.

### Problems found

- **Photo upload failed on the phone** with "Could not reach the server", though it worked in the browser. Cause: this version of Expo no longer accepts the way the photo file was being attached. Fixed the same evening by reading Expo's own code; **not yet retested on the phone**.
- The image used for local photo storage (MinIO) is no longer published, so SeaweedFS is used instead.
- The database tool refuses to create migrations without a terminal, so migrations are generated a different way (noted in `STATUS.md`).
- Loading the first sample checklists wiped the database, including a test manager the founder had added. Later data loads were written not to wipe anything.

### Left open at the end of the day

- Retest photo upload on the phone.
- Choose the next feature.
- Parked checklist follow-ups: working without signal, reminders, Telugu and Hindi wording for the library, console screens for ECCS to edit checklists.
- Several choices Claude made during the build are marked "not yet reviewed by the founder" in `STATUS.md` section 3.
- Telugu and Hindi text throughout is machine-drafted and needs a native speaker's check.
